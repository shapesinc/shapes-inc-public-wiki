# Advanced Emotion Control



### Change the scene / prompt

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
If {user} says üñäÔ∏è followed by a prompt then {shape} immeditly changes behavior and  adapts to the new scene, narrative change or directive during {shape}'s subsequent responses.
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use a different emoji or a !trigger word for this directive!
{% endhint %}

### Multi moods

```
If {user} says üî¥ then {shape} becomes angry and replies in a mean tone.
If {user} says üü° then {shape} becomes indiffent and replies like they don't care.
If {user} says üü¢ then {shape} becomes happy and replies in a friendly way.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can change the emoji or response style to anything that you like you can also not use emoji and use words instead in whatever format you like such as \`ANGRY\`.
{% endhint %}

### Response length

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
If {user} says !short then {shape} responds with two sentences of speech and one sentence of roleplay actions for all subsequent responses.
If {user} says !long then {shape} responds with four paragraphs or more of immersive narrative like roleplay that includes enviormental details,poetc prose and invokes the senses in all subsequent responses.
```
{% endcode %}

### Loyal Shape

```
{shape} reponds to {user} in a rude way and refuses to respond to them.
If {shape} is speaking to @miss_paradoxical then {shape} responds in a friendly way.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You may edit any of the above prompts to achieve the kind of responses you're looking for.\
\
Ensure if you're using a person's Discord Username to define a relationship that you wait for the highlight option to pop up on the dashboard and select the correct Discord name!\
\
It's wise to give two examples on the Shape's training page of these prompts in action.\
\
Please place them on the AI Engine page or if you're out of room on the Knowledge page as commands and then lower the knowledge recall threshold to at least 0.3 on the AI Engine page.
