# Enhancing the interaction with shapes

## **Welcome Messages**

**How It Works**

Whenever a pre-set trigger word is mentioned in the server, your shape will generate a response, keeping the interaction fun and dynamic.

2. Navigate to the **Server Settings** tab.
3. Select your server and scroll down to the **Trigger Words** section.
